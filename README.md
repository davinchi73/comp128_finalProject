Project Goal - We attempted to create a visualization GUI in Java that would be able to accurately represent the automatic balancing operations done with an AVL Binary search Tree and a Black and Red Binary Search Tree. We allowed to user to input an array of values (one input at a time) with no duplicate values, and a maximum number of values that would represent a complete and full Binary Search Tree (31) of height 4. Our GUI also prints out the Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals of the tree that is created. Each traversal is represented in its array form, with the order of the array being the order of the nodes to be traversed. Another strict boundary we made sure to add was that each value added to the Binary Search Tree through user input can ONLY be an Integer (not a double or string or anything else).

Steps to run our project :
    - 1. Upon running the app, select either the Black and Red or AVL picture to select which type of automatic rebalancing will be implemented.
    - 2.
